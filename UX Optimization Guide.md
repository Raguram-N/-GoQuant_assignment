## Recommendation 1 – Search Bar Missing
**Issue:** Users cannot quickly find specific car models or makes due to the absence of a search functionality.  
**UX Recommendation:** Introduce a prominent, easily accessible search bar on the dashboard and car listing pages. Include features like auto-suggestions and filters to improve findability and reduce user effort.

## Recommendation 2 – Navigation Clarity
**Issue:** Some navigation links are not clearly distinguishable or logically grouped.  
**UX Recommendation:** Organize main navigation links into clearly defined sections with descriptive labels. Use hover states and icons for better recognition.

## Recommendation 3 – Button Visibility
**Issue:** Certain buttons (e.g., Register, Vote) are not immediately noticeable or are disabled without clear indication.  
**UX Recommendation:** Make primary action buttons visually prominent with consistent styling and provide feedback on disabled state and requirements to enable.

## Recommendation 4 – Form Field Validation
**Issue:** Users are not guided on how to fill forms correctly.  
**UX Recommendation:** Add inline validation, hints, and tooltips for form fields, especially for passwords, emails, and required fields.

## Recommendation 5 – Mobile Responsiveness
**Issue:** Layouts and interactive elements are not fully optimized for smaller screens.  
**UX Recommendation:** Ensure all pages and forms adapt seamlessly to mobile devices. Test buttons, menus, and voting functionality across screen sizes.

## Recommendation 6 – Feedback on Actions
**Issue:** Users do not always get clear confirmation after actions like voting or updating profile.  
**UX Recommendation:** Provide instant, visible feedback such as toast messages, notifications, or subtle animations after user actions.

## Recommendation 7 – Color Contrast & Readability
**Issue:** Text and UI elements have insufficient contrast against background, affecting readability.  
**UX Recommendation:** Apply accessible color contrast ratios and font sizes. Ensure readability in all themes and lighting conditions.

## Recommendation 8 – Loading Indicators
**Issue:** Pages or actions with delay provide no indication, causing user confusion.  
**UX Recommendation:** Implement loading spinners or progress bars for actions like page load, voting, and data fetch.

## Recommendation 9 – Profile Page Layout
**Issue:** Profile fields are cluttered and not grouped logically.  
**UX Recommendation:** Organize profile information into clear sections (Personal Info, Contact, Security) with collapsible panels if needed.

## Recommendation 10 – Error Message Visibility
**Issue:** Validation or error messages are not prominent and can be missed.  
**UX Recommendation:** Display error messages near relevant fields in red with clear text. Use consistent styling and ensure they are accessible on all devices.
